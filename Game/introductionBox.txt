Welcome to the great kingdom of TheGame!

This land has way too much space, so thats where you come in!
Your job is to fill as many tiles as you can, with buildings
or workers. And you must hurry, your opponents are doing the
same thing!

In this world your job is to micromanage your own HQ, and
all that spawns from it.

First you should build a Tyokkari, that is all you can
do after all. When you have your Tyokkari, you can start
recruiting all kinds of workers!

when clicking on a tile that is close enough to your
HQ or Outpost, you can build, or assign object to it.

Buildings you can buy:
Farm - best for food production. Fairly cheap.
Mine - Best for money. More expensive.

All worker types have specific tiles or buildings they can be
assigned to. Workers (the ones with axes) can be places on
Grassland or Forest tiles. Farmers can be placed only on farms,
and miners can only be placed on mines.
Know that buildings do not produce anything without anyone
working on them. And all worker types eat away at your resources,
even when not assigned to anything.

When you run out of tiles you can build on, Build an Outpost,
it increases your reach by 5x5 around it.

You win by getting more points than your opponents,
good Luck!
