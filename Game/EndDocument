Game rules:

Goal is to gather as much points as possible. At the start of the game players
decide the game mode: points or rounds. In points, the winner is the one who
exceeds the points limit first. In rounds, the winner is decided by who has the
most points at the end of the round limit.

Player gets points from building buildings, buying workers and having workers work.
Players can only assign workers and buildings on an area that they own. At the start
of the game, players own 5x5 area around their HQ which is located in one of the
corners of the map. HQ coordinates for
players: p1: 0,0, p2: 11, 11 p3: 11, 0, p4: 0, 11.

Players can expand their owned area by placing a outpost onto a tile. Outpost
expands the owned area by 3x3 around the outpost.

Workers are hardworking and terrority aware people, who don't care for facilities
or machinery. That's why they can only be placed on empty forest or grassland tiles.
Once assigned, they will not move and will work until the world collapses around them.
Will gather resources from their tile at the end of each round.
-Worker on Grassland will gather 4 food + 1 point
-Worker on Forest will gather 2 food, 3 wood + 1 point

Farmers belong to an old tribe full of hillbilly rednecks. They only agree to
work on a well established farm.
-Farmer on a farm will gather 8 money, 18 food + 2 points

Miners also are quite picky on their tasks. They can only be assigned onto mines.
-Miner on a mine will gather 7 money, -2 food, 20 stone, 13 ore + 5 points

The map has 4 types of tiles. Forest, grassland, mountain & water.
-Forest: Can have worker, outpost or työkkäri.
-Grassland: Can have worker, farm & farmer, työkkäri, outpost.
-Mountain: Can have Mine & miner
-Water: Player can't place anything on water. It's only purpose to be in the way.

Player has 5 types of buildings: HQ, työkkäri, farm, mine and outpost.

HQ: Determines player starting corner. Grants perk: "Town mayor". Has no other
functionality. It doesn't matter if HQ sits on top of a water or in a mountain.
IT IS SPECIAL.

Työkkäri: Can be placed on forest, grassland. Enables the player to recruit ("Osta")
different kinds of workers. All types can be recruited at any time. Player can
only have 1 työkkäri.

Farm: Can be placed only to grasslands. Is needed to place a farmer onto a tile.

Mine: Can be placed only to mountain tile. Is needed to place a miner onto a tile.

Outpost: Expands the players' owned tiles by 2 tiles around the outpost.


Game instructions:
First you select a tile by clicking it. After selection, the available actions
can be determined from clickable buttons. Assigning workers is permanent. You can't
move them afterwards. Player can't build onto a tile which has a worker in it.
Try to get more points than your opponents!

Class resposibilites:
- MapWindow is our god-like class that handles almost everything in our game. We
are deeply sorry for this. Please forgive us. responsibilities: updating hud,
keeping track of game state, managing player actions
- Gamemenu takes player names, game mode and starts the game or closes the window.
- GameEventHandler is responsible for modifying resources for each player.
- ObjectManager stores all the tiles and workers of the map.
- PlayerObject has responsibility over players' current resources, owned tiles
and available workers.
- GameScene tells if a tile has been clicked, and sets the right sizes for mapitems.
- MapItem sets the objects to right coordinates and also is responsible for using
correct images for objects.
- TeamResourceMaps has all resource maps for inherited objects.
- Tiles & Buildings are responsible for their corresponding object.

Division of labour:
The project was mostly done together on one computer. While one did coding the
other gave moral support AND hc googling.

--Aleksi
- Object manager unit tests
- Inherited scene and mapitem
- Inherited farmer and miner
- Gamemenu dialog
- Most of the images

--Sampo
- GameEventHandler unit tests
- Inherited tiles and buildings
- End screen
- EndDocument and Documentation
- Lots of moral support

--Together
- Almost everything
